Obtain the accuracy configuration for this similar model from the OMZ. This can be done in two ways: \n\ta. Import this model into the DL Workbench, create a project with it and the dataset you use in the current project, and go to the advanced accuracy settings for this model. \n\tb. Search for the accuracy configuration file in the [OMZ GitHub](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master/tools/accuracy_checker/configs) repository. \n3. Copy the contents of the OMZ model configuration and paste them into the code editor on the left. Do not override the original content of the editor. \n4.
