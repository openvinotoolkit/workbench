    "Inference plays a crucial part in the OpenVINO toolkit. In this tutorial, we will cover only the basics using CPU specific terminology. Note that for devices other than the CPU, the terms may be different.\n",

    "The inference of a network is the execution of a computational graph consisting of different operations. Inference requests – abstraction over neural network execution (inference) used by OpenVINO [OpenVINO Runtime](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_Runtime_User_Guide.html) (IE) runtime. Available cores are evenly distributed between the streams. Internally, the execution resources are split/pinned into execution streams.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Streams – number of inference requests running in parallel. \n",
    "Batch – number of images propagated to the network at a time. The time required to process one image is called Latency. The lower the value, the better.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asynchronous API\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous inference request runs an inference pipeline asynchronously in one or several task executors depending on a device pipeline structure. While some of the Infer Requests are processed by OpenVINO Runtime, the other ones can be filled with new frame data and asynchronously started, rather than wait for the inference to complete. Multiple requests are executed asynchronously and the throughput is measured in images per second by dividing the number of images that were processed by the processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can run inference and simultaneously encode the resulting or previous frames or run further inference, like emotion detection on top of the face detection results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Changing the number of streams and batches usually is more effective in the high-performance applications, where a lot of images are being processed simultaneously."
