Deep Learning Workbench (DL Workbench) provides a web-based graphical environment to visualize, fine-tune, and compare performance of deep learning models on various Intel® architecture configurations. With the DL Workbench UI, you can use OpenVINO components like Model Downloader, Open Model Zoo, Model Optimizer, Post-training Optimization Tool, Accuracy Checker, and Benchmark Tool without having to write any code.
