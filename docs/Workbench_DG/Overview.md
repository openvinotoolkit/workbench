# OpenVINO™ Deep Learning Workbench Overview {#workbench_docs_Workbench_DG_Introduction}

Deep Learning Workbench (DL Workbench) is an official OpenVINO™ graphical interface designed to make the production of pretrained deep learning Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing models significantly easier. 

Minimize the inference-to-deployment workflow timing for neural models right in your browser: import a model, analyze its performance and accuracy, visualize the outputs, optimize and make the final model deployment-ready in a matter of minutes. DL Workbench takes you through the full OpenVINO™ workflow, providing the opportunity to learn about various toolkit components.

DL Workbench enables you to get a detailed performance assessment, explore inference configurations, and obtain an optimized model ready to be deployed on various Intel® configurations, such as client and server CPU, Intel® Processor Graphics (GPU), Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS 2), and Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Intel® Movidius™ VPUs.

DL Workbench also provides the [JupyterLab environment](Jupyter_Notebooks.md) that helps you quick start with OpenVINO™ API and command-line interface (CLI). Follow the full OpenVINO workflow created for your model and learn about different toolkit components.

## User Goals

DL Workbench helps achieve your goals depending on the stage of your deep learning journey. 

If you are a beginner in the deep learning field, the DL Workbench provides you with
learning opportunities:
* Learn what neural networks are, how they work, and how to examine their architectures. 
* Learn the basics of neural network analysis and optimization before production.
* Get familiar with the OpenVINO™ ecosystem and its main components without installing it on your system.

If you have enough experience with neural networks, DL Workbench provides you with a
convenient web interface to optimize your model and prepare it for production:
* Measure and interpret model performance.
* Tune the model for enhanced performance.
* Analyze the quality of your model and visualize output.

## OpenVINO™ Toolkit Components

The intuitive web-based interface of the DL Workbench enables you to easily use various
OpenVINO™ toolkit components:

Component  |                 Description 
|------------------|------------------|
| [Open Model Zoo](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_tools_downloader.html)| Get access to the collection of high-quality pre-trained deep learning [public](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_models_group_public.html) and [Intel-trained](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_models_group_intel.html) models trained to resolve a variety of different tasks. 
| [Model Optimizer](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html) |Optimize and transform models trained in supported frameworks to the IR format. <br>Supported frameworks include TensorFlow\*, Caffe\*, Kaldi\*, MXNet\*, and ONNX\* format.  
| [Benchmark Tool](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_inference_engine_tools_benchmark_tool_README.html)| Estimate deep learning model inference performance on supported devices.   
| [Accuracy Checker](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/omz_tools_accuracy_checker.html)| Evaluate the accuracy of a model by collecting one or several metric values. 
| [Post-Training Optimization Tool](@ref pot_introduction)| Optimize pretrained models with lowering the precision of a model from floating-point precision(FP32 or FP16) to integer precision (INT8), without the need to retrain or fine-tune models.                               |
